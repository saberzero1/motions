A polished, Neovim-native experience inside [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Vim Motions adds what's missing from Obsidian's built-in Vim mode: Markdown-aware text objects, structural navigation, hard-wrap formatting, workspace keyboard control, EasyMotion, a telescope-style fuzzy picker, Lua configuration with `vim.keymap.set` / `vim.opt` / `vim.fn` / `vim.api` / `vim.ob` / `vim.tbl_*` / autocommands / timers / highlight groups / global keymaps / which-key labels, and a built-in `.obsidian.vimrc` loader.

## Feature highlights

- **[[text-objects|Markdown text objects]]** — operate on bold, italic, code, math, links, blockquotes, code blocks, tables, and more with standard Vim operators
- **[[structural-navigation|Structural navigation]]** — jump between headings, lists, links, and buffers with `]h`, `]l`, `]n`, `]b`
- **[[lua-config|Lua configuration]]** — `.obsidian.init.lua` with `vim.keymap.set`, `vim.opt` (including `guicursor`), `vim.fn` (including `undotree()`), `vim.api` (buffer APIs, `nvim_set_hl`), `vim.ob` (68 Obsidian-specific functions: metadata, filesystem, UI, cursor, surround, leader), `vim.tbl_*`, `vim.json`, `vim.inspect`, `vim.regex` (ECMAScript RegExp), `vim.schedule`/`vim.uv` timers, 19 autocommand events, buffer-local keymaps, `vim.obsidian.keymap` (global keymaps), `vim.obsidian.whichkey` (which-key labels), async file reading (`vim.ob.fs.read`), multi-file configs via `require()`, and fuzzy picker API
- **[[vimrc|Built-in vimrc]]** — `.obsidian.vimrc` loader with 75+ configurable settings
- **[[flash|Flash motions]]** — enhanced `f`/`F`/`t`/`T` with jump labels, incremental `s` search, post-commit `/`/`?` labels, clever-f
- **[[easymotion|EasyMotion / Hop]]** — jump to any visible position with two keystrokes
- **[[workspace-navigation|Workspace keyboard control]]** — navigate panes, tabs, and sidebar without a mouse
- **[[surround|Surround]]** — add, change, or delete surrounding delimiters (nvim-surround parity, custom pairs)
- **[[hardwrap|Hard-wrap formatting]]** — Markdown-aware `gq`/`gw` operators
- **[[ex-commands|100+ ex commands]]** — `:sp`, `:vs`, `:e`, `:grep`, `:ob`, fuzzy picker commands, and more
- **[[hint-mode|Vimium-style hints]]** — navigate the entire Obsidian UI with keyboard hints
- **[[undo-tree|Undo tree]]** — branching undo history visualization with `g-`/`g+` chronological navigation, `:earlier`/`:later` time travel, sidebar tree view, and optional persistence

## What's new in 0.108.0

- **Native highlights cleared on Escape** — Obsidian's built-in `is-flashing` highlights (shown after following an internal link like `[[Note#heading]]`) now clear when pressing Escape in normal mode, matching the behavior of the plugin's own search highlights. ([#122](https://github.com/saberzero1/motions/issues/122))
- **Chord display fixed for surround commands** — the status bar chord display now correctly accumulates all keystrokes during multi-key surround commands like `ysiwb` and `cs"(`. Previously, the chord disappeared partway through. ([#123](https://github.com/saberzero1/motions/issues/123))
- **Embedded table: keys no longer consumed during modals** — table-nav and cell-edit key handlers now yield to open modals (picker, command palette, settings), preventing keys typed into modal inputs from being intercepted by the table handler. ([#120](https://github.com/saberzero1/motions/issues/120))
- **Cursor-aware table: cursor displacement guard** — a transaction filter prevents Obsidian's Live Preview from snapping the cursor to the table header row during editing. ([#121](https://github.com/saberzero1/motions/issues/121))
- **Type safety improvements** — replaced ~50 unsafe `as unknown as` casts with proper types via `@obsidian-typings/obsidian-public-latest`
