and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## 0.6.0 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

#### Neovim deviation closure

- `di*`/`da*` with cursor on delimiter now correctly no-ops — previously the delimiter scanner treated the delimiter position as "inside", operating on the text. Matches Neovim behavior.
- `diB`/`daB` on nested blockquotes (`>>`) now correctly scopes to the innermost nesting level — previously deleted all blockquote content regardless of depth.
- `P` (paste before cursor) now places cursor on the last pasted character, matching Neovim — previously CM Vim placed cursor one position further.
- Rewrote `gP`/`gp` to use direct register-reading implementation instead of delegating through `Vim.handleKey`, avoiding re-entrancy issues with the new `P` override.

#### Neovim test infrastructure

- Ex commands (`:s`, `:sort`, `:d`, `:yank`, `:join`, `:noh`, `:undo`, `:redo`, `:global`) now work correctly in Neovim golden comparison tests — added `dispatchVimKeys` routing that detects Ex command sequences and dispatches them via `Vim.handleEx()` instead of character-by-character key input.

### Changed

- `test/neovim/deviations.ts` reduced from 28 to 19 entries (9 removed, 3 new cursor-position deviations added for Ex commands where content is correct but cursor placement differs from Neovim).
- `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` behavioral deviations table expanded with 5 entries for confirmed upstream constraints (`dG`, `>>`, `V+>`, `d0`, `<<`) that cannot be intercepted via `mapCommand` due to codemirror-vim's operator-pending dispatch architecture.

### Added

#### Neovim golden comparison testing

- Neovim-backed golden comparison system for Tier 1 Vim behavior tests, inspired by Zed editor's `NeovimBackedTestContext`. Sends identical keystrokes to both Obsidian and a headless Neovim instance, compares resulting editor state (content, cursor, mode).
- `test/neovim/client.ts` — Neovim RPC client wrapping the official `neovim` npm package. Spawns `nvim --embed --headless`, provides `setContent()`, `setCursor()`, `input()`, `getContent()`, `getCursor()`, `getMode()`, `getRegister()`.
- `test/neovim/compare.ts` — state comparison helpers: `getObsidianState()`, `getNeovimState()`, `compareStates()`.
- `test/neovim/golden.ts` — golden file read/write infrastructure with `loadGoldenFile()`, `saveGoldenFile()`, `findGoldenCase()`.
- `test/neovim/deviations.ts` — known deviation registry tracking behavioral differences from Neovim. `isKnownDeviation()` silently allows expected behavioral differences during golden comparison.
- `test/neovim/test-wrapper.ts` — `testWithNeovim()` function: the primary test format for Tier 1 tests. Operates in playback mode (golden files, no Neovim needed) or compare mode (`NEOVIM_COMPARE=1`, live Neovim).
- `test/neovim/test-definitions.ts` — 199 test case definitions across 16 suites covering motions, operators, text objects, editing, yank/put, insert entry, visual mode, g-commands, bracket commands, insert mode, scroll (Ctrl-A/X), and Ex commands.
- `test/neovim/record-golden.ts` — standalone script to record golden files from Neovim without running Obsidian. Usage: `npm run test:neovim-record`.
- `test/neovim/smoke.ts` — Neovim client smoke test. Usage: `npm run test:neovim-smoke`.
- 16 golden files in `test/neovim/golden-data/` recorded against Neovim 0.12.2.
- npm scripts: `test:neovim-smoke`, `test:neovim-record`, `test:neovim-compare`.

#### Edge-case test expansion

- 110 new edge-case tests translated from Neovim's legacy test suite (`test/old/testdir/`), replit/codemirror-vim (`test/vim_test.js`), and VSCodeVim (`test/motion.test.ts`).
- Word motion edge cases: `w`/`b`/`e`/`ge` across empty lines, at document boundaries, with punctuation, count clipping, line wrapping.
- Operator edge cases: `dw` at end of line, `dd` on last/only line, `d2w`/`2dd`, `D`, `dk`, `dj` on last line, `de`/`db`, `dG`/`dgg`, `dfx`/`dtx`, `cw` vs `ce`, `cc`/`C`/`2cc`.
- Text object edge cases: `iw`/`aw` on whitespace, `iW`/`aW` with mixed punctuation, nested `i(`/`i{`/`i[`, `di(` across lines, `d2aw` with count, `i"` with escaped quotes.
- Character search edge cases: `f`/`t` not crossing line boundaries, `2t`/`2F` counts, `;` after `t`, `,` reversal.
- Visual mode edge cases: `viw`, `v3l+d`, `gv` reselect, `V+y` linewise, visual at document boundaries.
- Yank/register edge cases: `yy`/`yw` linewise flag, `y$` without newline, numbered register rotation, `"Ayy` append, `".` last inserted text.
- Repeat edge cases: `.` after `dw`/`>>`/`cw+text`, `3.` with count.
- Search edge cases: `*`/`#` wrap-around.
- Mark edge cases: mark persistence after edit, `'.` jump to last change.

### Fixed

- `test/coverage-report.ts` — replaced broken regex YAML parser with proper YAML parsing via the `yaml` package, fixing `npm run test:coverage` which previously reported 0/0 on the multi-line manifest format.

### Changed

- Replaced `js-yaml` dependency with [`yaml`](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml) — better maintained, YAML 1.2 spec-compliant, ships its own types.
- All 16 Tier 1 test files (`test/specs/vim-builtin/*.e2e.ts`) now use `testWithNeovim()` as the primary test format alongside existing `it()` blocks. Neovim lifecycle hooks (`startNvim`/`stopNvim`) added to top-level `before`/`after`.
- `test/helpers.ts` — added `vimRawKeys()` for raw byte key sequences (supports `\x1b` for Escape, `\x01`-`\x1a` for Ctrl keys, `\n` for Enter).

### Documentation

- README: added "Testing strategy" section describing the Neovim golden comparison system, test types (`[nvim]`/`[obsidian]`/Tier 2), and available test commands.
- `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`: added "Test-discovered behavioral discrepancies" section documenting 6 bugs found during edge-case test translation (`dG` trailing newline, `iB` nesting, `di*` on delimiter, dot-repeat of `cw`, `)` cursor off-by-one, `n`/`N` wrap-around).

## 0.5.1 - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- `.obsidian.vimrc` is now also loaded on startup, instead of only on leaf change.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

#### New Vim commands

- `Q` — replay last recorded macro (Neovim default, maps to `@@`)
- `Y` — yank to end of line (Neovim default, maps to `y$`; overrides CM Vim's `yy` behavior)
- `ga` — show character info under cursor (codepoint, hex, octal) via Notice
- `gp` — paste and move cursor past pasted text
- `gn` / `gN` — select next/previous search match (CM Vim native, now tested)
- `g;` / `g,` — jump to older/newer change position (changelist navigation)
- `zO` / `zC` / `zA` — recursive fold open/close/toggle (maps to Obsidian's fold commands)
- `it` / `at` — HTML/XML tag text objects, implemented via raw text scanning since CM Vim's built-in `expandToTag` is inactive in Markdown mode. Supports single-line, multiline, and nested tags.
- `<C-v>` — visual block mode (CM Vim native, now tested)

#### New Ex commands

- `:e {file}` / `:edit {file}` — open file by name in vault
- `:e!` / `:edit!` — revert current file to saved version
- `:enew` — create new untitled note
- `:saveas {file}` — save current buffer as new file
- `:update` / `:up` — save current file (alias for `:w`)
- `:x` / `:xit` — write-if-modified and close
- `:xa` / `:xall` — write-if-modified all and close all
- `:find {file}` / `:fin` — find and open file by partial name match
- `:read {file}` / `:r` — insert file contents at cursor position
- `:b {name}` / `:buffer {name}` — switch to tab matching name
- `:bf` / `:bfirst` — go to first tab
- `:bl` / `:blast` — go to last tab
- `:bw` / `:bwipeout` — close current tab
- `:sp` / `:split` — horizontal split
- `:vs` / `:vsplit` — vertical split
- `:new` — horizontal split with new note
- `:vnew` — vertical split with new note
- `:tabnew` / `:tabedit` — open new tab (optionally with file)
- `:tabclose` / `:tabc` — close current tab
- `:tabonly` / `:tabo` — close all other tabs
- `:tabfirst` / `:tabrewind` — go to first tab
- `:tablast` / `:tabl` — go to last tab
- `:version` / `:ve` — show plugin version
- `:delmarks {marks}` — delete specified marks
- `:changes` — show change list in modal

#### Test infrastructure

- Shared test helpers module (`test/helpers.ts`) with `setupEditor`, `getCursorPos`, `getEditorValue`, `getRegisterContent`, `getVimMode`, `vimKeys`, and timing constants
- `unsupported()` and `deviation()` test helpers for documenting known limitations and behavioral differences in test reports
- Neovim command index manifest (`test/neovim-command-index.yaml`) tracking 227 commands with tier classification, test status, and test file references
- Coverage report script (`test/coverage-report.ts`) — run via `npm run test:coverage`
- 16 new test files in `test/specs/vim-builtin/` covering normal mode motions, search, editing, yank/put, insert entry, scroll, marks/jumps, g-commands, z-commands, bracket commands, text objects, operators, visual mode, insert mode, and Ex commands
- 7 spike tests for register access, paste marks, editor extensions, tag text objects, CM Vim Ex command probing, Ex command conflict checking, and vimrc mapping diagnostics
- Comprehensive E2E test coverage for `<C-w>h/j/k/l` pane focus, `H`/`M`/`L` screen-relative motions, `?` backward search, `zO`/`zC`/`zA` recursive folds, and all new Ex commands
- E2E test for scrolloff hot-reload: verifies scroll margins update when `scrolloffLines` changes
- E2E test for `Y`/`Q` independence from workspace navigation: verifies `Y` still yanks to end of line when workspace nav is disabled
- GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request) with required KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md checklist

### Fixed

- Scrolloff now works correctly — previously used CSS `scroll-padding` which CodeMirror 6 ignores (it uses manual scroll calculations, not `Element.scrollIntoView`). Replaced with `EditorView.scrollMargins` facet, which CM6 respects when scrolling the cursor into view
- Scrolloff setting now applies immediately when changed in settings — previously required a plugin reload because the slider's `onChange` handler did not trigger `reloadFeatures()` and `reloadFeatures()` itself had no scrolloff handling
- Removed deprecated `setDynamicTooltip()` call on scrolloff slider — the value is now always shown inline by Obsidian
- `Y` (`y$`) and `Q` (`@@`) Neovim default remaps now work regardless of the "Workspace navigation" toggle — previously these were registered inside `registerWorkspaceNavigation()` and would stop working when workspace nav was disabled
- Vimrc loader now shows a Notice on load: reports the number of commands applied on success, warns when the file is not found, and warns when the file contains no commands
- Vimrc commands are now processed through codemirror-vim's Ex command handler (`handleEx`) instead of the programmatic API, matching obsidian-vimrc-support's approach for improved compatibility
- ESLint `import/no-extraneous-dependencies` error on `@codemirror/view` — added `import/core-modules` setting and `peerDependencies` for `@codemirror/*` packages provided by Obsidian at runtime
- Removed unused variables: `totalLines` in `tag.ts`, `openEndIndex`/`closeStartIndex` in `tag.ts`, `active` in `commands.ts`, `newLeaf` in `commands.ts`

### Changed

- Scrolloff implementation rewritten from CSS `scroll-padding` inline styles to `EditorView.scrollMargins` extension registered via `registerEditorExtension`. The `ScrolloffManager` class no longer manages event listeners or DOM manipulation — it updates a shared margin variable read by the CM6 facet callback.
- Refactored 8 existing test files to use shared helpers from `test/helpers.ts` instead of locally defined `getEditorValue`, `getCursorLine`, and `vimKeys` functions
- Test-vault `hotkeys.json` now unbinds Obsidian shortcuts that conflict with Vim commands (`Ctrl+W`, `Ctrl+N`, `Ctrl+P`, `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+O`)
- Tag text objects (`it`/`at`) changed from `unsupported` skip to working plugin-implemented text objects
- `ChangeList` class gains `getEntries()` and `getIndex()` public accessors for the `:changes` Ex command
- `Y` and `Q` Neovim default remaps moved from `registerWorkspaceNavigation()` to the always-on initialization path in `onload()` and `reloadFeatures()`
- Vimrc loader's `loadVimrc()` now returns a `VimrcLoadResult` with `found`, `commandCount`, `path`, and `maps` fields
- Vimrc loader refactored to use `vim.handleEx()` for command application instead of direct `vim.map()`/`vim.setOption()` API calls, improving compatibility with obsidian-vimrc-support configurations
- Vimrc loader now collects parsed map commands as `DeferredMap` entries and re-applies them via `vim.map()`/`vim.noremap()` on subsequent `active-leaf-change` events, attempting to restore mappings that CM Vim may lose during editor reinitialization
- Vimrc loader intercepts `set textwidth=N` / `set tw=N` lines and directly updates the plugin's internal `textwidthValue`, bypassing CM Vim's option callback chain
- `getTextwidth()` now reads from CM Vim's option via `Vim.getOption('textwidth')` as a fallback when the plugin's internal value hasn't been updated
- Vimrc loading deferred to first `active-leaf-change` event to guarantee editor availability, matching obsidian-vimrc-support's loading strategy

### Documentation

- README: added `:wa` / `:wall` to Ex commands table, `g<C-t>` to workspace keybindings table
- README: corrected `set textwidth=N` claim — now notes the known limitation and provides the runtime workaround via developer console
- `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` expanded with comprehensive "Neovim Ex commands not applicable in Obsidian" section covering 30+ commands across 8 categories (shell, quickfix, tags, scripting, diff, etc.) with specific reasoning
- `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` expanded with "Behavioral deviations" section documenting 6 commands that work differently from Neovim (`Y`, `Q`, `:wall`, `gf`, `zO`/`zC`/`zA`, `it`/`at`)
- `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`: added "`nmap L $` does not work via vimrc" section with full diagnostic findings
- `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`: added "`set textwidth` via vimrc does not affect `gq`" section with root cause analysis
- `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`: replaced "Scrolloff cleanup on disable" section with "Scrolloff line height assumption" (22px hardcoded)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **Lowered minimum Obsidian version from 1.13.0 to 1.1.1** — audited all Obsidian API usage and confirmed no API newer than 0.13.8 is required. Users on Obsidian 1.1.1 and later can now use the plugin.
- Replaced Obsidian's `setCssProps` prototype augmentation with standard `el.style.setProperty()` calls in EasyMotion and hint mode. Removes dependency on an undocumented global API whose introduction version is unknown, improving backward compatibility.
- Prefixed all plugin-owned CSS custom properties with `--vim-motions-` to avoid collisions with other plugins or themes:
    - `--em-left` → `--vim-motions-em-left`
    - `--em-top` → `--vim-motions-em-top`
    - `--hint-left` → `--vim-motions-hint-left`
    - `--hint-top` → `--vim-motions-hint-top`
    - `--hint-opacity` → replaced with `.is-dimmed` CSS class (avoids inline style assignment)

### Added

- E2E tests for blockquote text objects (`iB`/`aB`) and callout text objects (`io`/`ao`)
- E2E tests for buffer navigation (`]b`/`[b`)
- E2E tests for EasyMotion interaction (overlay appearance, dismissal, line/char label variants)
- E2E tests for workspace operations: splits (`<C-w>v`/`<C-w>s`), folds (`zc`/`zo`/`zM`/`zR`), tab navigation (`gT`), file switcher (`gf`), rename (`grn`), backlinks (`grr`), document stats (`g<C-g>`)
- E2E tests for ex commands with effect verification: `:q`, `:wq`, `:bp`, `:only`, `:back`, `:forward`, `:explorer`, `:ls`
- E2E tests for quality-of-life features: status bar mode display (NORMAL/INSERT/VISUAL), which-key overlay, ex command suggest
- E2E tests for settings hot-reload: toggling text objects, navigation, status bar, and EasyMotion on/off
- E2E tests for operator edge cases: bullet/numbered/nested list prefix preservation in `gq`, `gqj` (two-line wrap), `gqip` (paragraph reflow)
- E2E tests for text object edge cases: empty delimiters (`****`, `~~~~`, `====`), visual mode selection (`vi*`), yank (`yi*`)
- E2E tests for navigation edge cases: heading levels `]3`/`]4`/`[3`, ordered list navigation, last-heading boundary, cross-line link jumps

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- `gd` on wiki links with display names (`[[file|display name]]`) now correctly navigates to the file instead of creating a new file with the display name in the path
- `gd` on wiki links with heading fragments (`[[file#heading|display]]`) correctly preserves the heading target
- EasyMotion keybindings (`<leader><leader>w/j/f`) now work — previously registered as literal `<leader>` strings in `mapCommand` which could never match typed input
- Hint mode (`<leader><leader>h`) same fix as EasyMotion
- Leader key bindings configured via settings UI or `.obsidian.vimrc` now work when workspace navigation is disabled — `:ob` ex command is registered unconditionally instead of only when workspace nav is on
- Leader key bindings no longer silently fail when obsidian-vimrc-support is installed — removed unnecessary guard that skipped `:ob` registration
- Leader key bindings survive settings hot-reload — `:ob` is re-registered in `reloadFeatures()` so it isn't left as a noop after toggling any setting
- Which-key overlay now dismisses when a key is pressed after it appears — previously `show()` reset `pendingLeader` state, preventing dismissal
- Which-key overlay no longer leaks `active-leaf-change` event listeners on destroy
- `ExCommandSuggest` is rebuilt after settings hot-reload so the completion list stays current

### Added

- `]c` / `[c` as alternative keybindings for table cell navigation, for keyboards where `|` requires AltGr or modifier keys
- EasyMotion and hint mode bindings now appear in the which-key overlay
- Which-key overlay rebuilds after settings hot-reload

### Changed

- Plugin initialization order restructured: leader key resolution (vimrc loading) now happens before feature registration, so EasyMotion and hint mode receive the correct leader key
- `registerObCommand` extracted as a standalone function, called unconditionally in both `onload()` and `reloadFeatures()`
- `LeaderBinding` now tracks `source` (`'builtin'` or `'user'`) to support selective clearing during hot-reload
- `LeaderRegistry` gains `clearBuiltinBindings()` for clean re-registration during `reloadFeatures()`
- `registerEasyMotion()` and `registerWorkspaceNavigation()` accept `LeaderRegistry` parameter

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- Vimrc path now uses `Vault.configDir` instead of hardcoded `.obsidian`, supporting custom config directories
- Setting descriptions use dynamic config directory path
- `:ob` with no arguments now opens a searchable modal listing all command IDs instead of logging to the developer console
- Coexistence E2E test now opens a file before assertions, fixing CI race condition
- Removed deprecated `setDynamicTooltip()` call on scrolloff slider

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-13
